About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.",
    "HD 10180":"HD 10180 is a Sun-like star in the southern constellation Hydrus that is notable for its large planetary system. Since its discovery, at least seven planets, and possibly as many as nine, have been observed orbiting it, making it potentially the largest of all known planetary systems, including the Solar System. (Other stars with a large known number of planets include Kepler-90, TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-11, and 55 Cancri).",
    "Kepler-90":"Kepler-90 is a G-type main sequence star located about 2,545 light-years (780 pc) from Earth in the constellation of Draco. It is notable for having a planetary system that has an equal number of observed planets to the Solar System. On 14 December 2017, NASA and Google announced the discovery of an eighth planet, Kepler-90i, in the Kepler-90 system: the discovery was made using a new machine learning method developed by Google.",
    "Gliese 667 C":"Gliese 667 (142 G. Scorpii) is a triple-star system in the constellation Scorpius lying at a distance of about 6.8 pc (23.6 ly) from Earth. All three of the stars have masses smaller than the Sun. There is a 12th magnitude star close to the other three, but it is not gravitationally bound to the system. To the naked eye, the system appears to be a single faint star of magnitude 5.89. The system has a relatively high proper motion, exceeding 1 second of arc per year.The two brightest stars in this system, GJ 667 A and GJ 667 B, are orbiting each other at an average angular separation of 1.81 arcseconds with a high eccentricity of 0.58. At the estimated distance of this system, this is equivalent to a physical separation of about 12.6 AU, or nearly 13 times the separation of the Earth from the Sun. Their eccentric orbit brings the pair as close as about 5 AU to each other, or as distant as 20 AU, corresponding to an eccentricity of 0.6. This orbit takes approximately 42.15 years to complete and the orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 128° to the line of sight from the Earth. The third star, GJ 667 C, orbits the GJ 667 AB pair at an angular separation of about 30, which equates to a minimum separation of 230 AU.",
    "HD 219134":"HD 219134 (or HR 8832, or Gliese 892) is a main sequence star in the constellation of Cassiopeia. It is smaller and less luminous than our Sun, with a spectral class of K3V, which makes it an orange-red hued star. HR 8832 is relatively close to our system, with an estimated distance of 21.25 light years. This star is close to the limit of apparent magnitude that can still be seen by the unaided eye. The limit is considered to be magnitude 6 for most observers.",
    "tau ceti":"Tau Ceti, Latinized from τ Ceti, is a single star in the constellation Cetus that is spectrally similar to the Sun, although it has only about 78% of the Sun's mass. At a distance of just under 12 light-years (3.7 parsecs) from the Solar System, it is a relatively nearby star, and is the closest solitary G-class star. The star appears stable, with little stellar variation, and is metal-deficient.Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System.",
    "HD 40307":"HD 40307 is an orange (K-type) main-sequence star located approximately 42 light-years away in the constellation of Pictor (the Easel), taking its primary name from its Henry Draper Catalogue designation. It is calculated to be slightly less massive than the Sun. HD 40307 was observed during or before 1900 as part of the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung. The star has six known planets, three discovered in 2008 and three more in 2012. One of them, HD 40307 g, is a potential super-Earth in the habitable zone, with an orbital period of about 200 days. This object might be capable of supporting liquid water on its surface, although much more information must be acquired before its habitability can be assessed.",
    "Gliese 581":"Gliese 581 (/ˈɡliːzə/) is a star of spectral type M3V (a red dwarf) at the center of the Gliese 581 planetary system, about 20 light years away from Earth in the Libra constellation. Its estimated mass is about a third of that of the Sun, and it is the 89th closest known star to the Sun.",
    "TRAPPIST-1":"TRAPPIST-1, also designated as 2MASS J23062928-0502285, is an ultra-cool red dwarf star that is slightly larger but much more massive than the planet Jupiter, located 39.6 light-years (12.1 pc) from the Sun in the constellation Aquarius. Seven temperate terrestrial planets have been detected orbiting the star, a larger number than detected in any other planetary system. A study released in May 2017 suggests that the tightly packed exoplanets avoid colliding with one another due to orbits that are harmoniously resonant and, as a result, are stable for very long times. Astronomers first discovered three Earth-sized planets orbiting the dwarf star in 2015. A team led by Michaël Gillon (fr) at the University of Liège in Belgium detected the planets using transit photometry with the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. On 22 February 2017, astronomers announced four additional exoplanets around TRAPPIST-1. This work used the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope at Paranal, among others, and brought the total number of planets to seven, of which three are considered to be within its habitable zone. The others could also be habitable as they may possess liquid water somewhere on their surface. Depending on definition, up to six could be in the optimistic habitable zone (c, d, e, f, g, h), with estimated equilibrium temperatures of 170 K to 330 K."

    "Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler Mission, a project headed by NASA that was designed to search for Earth-like planets. Unlike stars such as Aldebaran or Sirius, Kepler-9 does not have a colloquial name.In June 2010, some 43 days after Kepler came online, its operating scientists submitted a list of over 700 exoplanet candidates for review. Of those, five were originally suspected to have more than one planet. Kepler-9 was one of the multiplanetary systems; it was identified as such when scientists noticed significant variations in the time intervals at which Kepler-9 was transited. Kepler-9 holds the first multiplanetary system discovered using the transit method. It is also the first planetary system where transiting planets were confirmed through transit timing variations method, allowing to calculate the masses of planets. The discovery of the planets was announced on August 26, 2010.",
    "Sun": "The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion[a] years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable. The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, one of which is the predominant calendar in use today.",
    "HD 10180":"Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of about 127 light-years (39 parsecs) from Earth.[9] The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 7.33, which is too faint to be viewed with the naked eye although it can be readily observed with a small telescope.[10] At a declination of −60°, this star cannot be seen at latitudes north of the tropics. HD 10180 is a G1V-type star, and thus generates energy at its core through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen. The mass of this star is estimated as 6% greater than the Sun's mass, it has a radius of 120% that of the Sun, and is radiating 149% of the Sun's luminosity. The effective temperature of the star's chromosphere is 5,911 K, giving it a yellow-hued glow like the Sun.[11] HD 10180 has a 20% higher abundance of elements other than hydrogen/helium compared to the Sun.[note 1] With an estimated age of 7.3 billion years, it is a stable star with no significant magnetic activity. The estimated period of rotation is about 24 days.[5]",
    "Kepler-90":"Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-90 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J18574403+4918185. It has the designation of KIC 11442793 in the Kepler Input Catalog, and given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-351 when it was found to have a transiting planet candidate.The star's planetary companion was discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. The name Kepler-90 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 90th star discovered by Kepler to have confirmed planets.The designation b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i derives from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other lowercase letters of the alphabet. In the case of Kepler-90, there are eight planets discovered, so designations up to i are used.",

    "HD 219134":"This star has a magnitude 9.4 companion at an angular separation of 106.6 arcseconds.[10] The star is reported to host a rocky super-Earth, HD 219134 b, based on size (1.6 times the size of Earth), and density (6.4 grams per cubic cm). A further three exoplanets, two super-Earths and one Jovian world, have been deduced using Harps-N radial velocity data. Two more were discovered two months later. A total of four independent studies regarding the planetary system of HR 8832 have been done, with many of their results conflicting with each other. As of March 2017, the star is known to have at least 5 planets, two of them (HD 219134 b and c) known to be transiting, rocky Super-Earths. Two previously reported planets, HD 219134 e and HD 219134 g, were not found in following HARPS-N analyses in March 2017 by Gillon et al.",
    "tau ceti":"Since December 2012, there has been evidence of possibly five planets orbiting Tau Ceti, with two of these being potentially in the habitable zone. Because of its debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than Earth. Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Given its stability, similarity and relative proximity to the Sun, Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and it appears in some science fiction literature. It can be seen with the unaided eye as a third-magnitude star. As seen from Tau Ceti, the Sun would be a third-magnitude star in the northern hemisphere constellation Boötes.",
    "HD 40307":"As a K-type star, HD 40307 emits orange-tinted light.[1] It has only about three-quarters of the Sun's radius and mass. Its temperature is measured at slightly under 5000 K. This is relatively high for a K-type star, approaching the temperatures normally found in G-type stars such as the Sun. The astronomers who discovered the planets orbiting HD 40307 suggested that the metallicities of stars determine whether or not the planetary bodies that orbit them will be terrestrial, like Earth, or gaseous, like Jupiter and Saturn.",
    "Gliese 581":"The name Gliese 581 refers to the catalog number from the 1957 survey Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars of 965 stars located within 20 parsecs of the Earth. Other names of this star include BD-07° 4003 (BD catalogue, first known publication) and HO Librae (variable star designation). It does not have an individual name such as Sirius or Procyon.[2][17] The star is a red dwarf with spectral type M3V, located 20.4 light-years away from Earth. It is located about two degrees north of Beta Librae, the brightest star in the Libra constellation. Its mass is estimated to be approximately a third that of the Sun, and it is the 89th closest known star system to the Sun. An M-class dwarf star such as Gliese 581 has a much lower mass than the Sun, causing the core region of the star to fuse hydrogen at a significantly lower rate. From the apparent magnitude and distance, astronomers have estimated an effective temperature of 3200 K and a visual luminosity of 0.2 percent of that of the Sun.[20] However, a red dwarf such as Gliese 581 radiates primarily in the near infrared, with peak emission at a wavelength of roughly 830 nm (estimated using Wien's displacement law, which assumes the star radiates as a black body), so such an estimate will underestimate the star's total luminosity.[5] (For comparison, the peak emission of the Sun is roughly 530 nm, in the middle of the visible part of the spectrum). When radiation over the entire spectrum is taken into account (not just the part that humans are able to see), something known as the bolometric correction, this star has a bolometric luminosity 1.3% of the Sun's total luminosity.[5][20] A planet would need to be situated much closer to this star in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as the Earth. The region of space around a star where a planet would receive roughly the same energy as the Earth is sometimes termed the ]'Goldilocks Zone', or, more prosaically, the habitable zone. The extent of such a zone is not fixed and is highly specific for each planetary system.[21]",

          <p class="w3-large">TRAPPIST-1, also designated as 2MASS J23062928-0502285, is an ultra-cool red dwarf star that is slightly larger but much more massive than the planet Jupiter, located 39.6 light-years (12.1 pc) from the Sun in the constellation Aquarius. Seven temperate terrestrial planets have been detected orbiting the star, a larger number than detected in any other planetary system. A study released in May 2017 suggests that the tightly packed exoplanets avoid colliding with one another due to orbits that are harmoniously resonant and, as a result, are stable for very long times. Astronomers first discovered three Earth-sized planets orbiting the dwarf star in 2015. A team led by Michaël Gillon (fr) at the University of Liège in Belgium detected the planets using transit photometry with the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. On 22 February 2017, astronomers announced four additional exoplanets around TRAPPIST-1. This work used the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope at Paranal, among others, and brought the total number of planets to seven, of which three are considered to be within its habitable zone. The others could also be habitable as they may possess liquid water somewhere on their surface. Depending on definition, up to six could be in the optimistic habitable zone (c, d, e, f, g, h), with estimated equilibrium temperatures of 170 K to 330 K.</p>
          <p class="w3-large w3-hide-medium">The star at the center of the system was discovered in 1999 during the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). It was entered in the subsequent catalog with the designation "2MASS J23062928-0502285". The numbers refer to the right ascension and declination of the star's position in the sky and the "J" refers to the Julian Epoch.

                The system was later studied by a team at the University of Liège, who made their initial observations using the TRAPPIST–South telescope from September to December 2015 and published their findings in the May 2016 issue of the journal Nature. The backronym TRAPPIST reflects the telescope's nationality by alluding to Belgium's famous Trappist beer, named after the Roman Catholic religious order, which the astronomers used to toast their discovery. Since the star hosted the first exoplanets discovered by this telescope, the discoverers accordingly designated it as "TRAPPIST-1".
                
                The planets are designated in the order of their discovery, beginning with b for the first planet discovered, c for the second and so on. Three planets around TRAPPIST-1 were first discovered and designated b, c and d in order of increasing orbital periods, and the second batch of discoveries was similarly designated e to h.</p>
